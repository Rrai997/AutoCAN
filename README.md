# AutoCAN
The AutoCAN dataset is a comprehensive dataset for automotive cybersecurity research, created using logged data from the OBD-II port. It includes both normal and attack data, with attack scenarios injected via the OBD-II port. This dataset is valuable for intrusion detection and security analysis in Controller Area Network (CAN). 
## Data Collection
- The dataset was collected from 10 different vehicles (3 Manufacturers) using an OBD-II logging tool.
- Attack data was generated by injecting various types of attacks through the OBD-II port.
- The dataset contains a mix of normal and malicious CAN messages.
## Attacks
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** – Overloading the CAN bus with high-priority messages.

- **Fuzzy Attack** – Sending random CAN messages to disrupt communication.

- **Spoofing Attack** – Injecting false messages to impersonate legitimate ECUs.

- **Replay Attack** – Capturing and retransmitting previously recorded messages.
## Features
Each CAN message in the dataset includes:
- Timestamp – Unix timestamp representing when the message was logged.
- CAN ID – The unique identifier of the message.
- Data Fields (D0-D7) – The payload of the CAN message in hexadecimal format.
- Class Label – Indicates whether the message is normal (**R**) or an attack (**T**).
